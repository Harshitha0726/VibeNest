# VibeNest - AI-Powered Music Recommendation System

## Overview

VibeNest is an AI-driven music recommendation system that personalizes song suggestions based on a user's current emotions. By leveraging facial expression recognition via a webcam or with the help of emoji, the system detects emotions and suggests music accordingly, enhancing the listening experience.

## How it works

**Webcam Mode**: The system captures an image of the userâ€™s face and processes it to detect emotions.

**Emoji Mode**: Users can manually choose an emoji that represents their current mood.

**Song Recommendation**: Based on the detected or selected emotion, the system fetches a playlist from the database and displays song recommendations with Spotify links.
